# **Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?** {.tabset}

## **Task Details** {#taskdetail}

### **Scenario** {#scenario}

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at
Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing
believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number
of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how
casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From
these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to
convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic
executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up
with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

### **About The Company**

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since
then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are
geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The
bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station
in the system anytime. Until now, Cyclistic's marketing strategy relied
on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments.

One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility
of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual
memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are
referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships
are Cyclistic members. Cyclistic's finance analysts have concluded that
annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the
pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno
believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to
future growth.

Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new
customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual
riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of
the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility
needs.

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at
converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that,
however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how
annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a
membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics.
Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical
bike trip data to identify trends.

### **Pricing**

| Passes             | Price                                                     |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Single-Ride Pass   | \$1 + \$0.16 / minute                                     |
| Full-Day Pass      | \$15 + \$0.16 / minute after 3 hours                      |
| Annual Memberships | \$119 annually + \$0.16 / minute after 45 minutes per day |
| E-Bike             | \$1 + \$0.39 / minute or \$0.16 / minute for members      |

### Riding Areas

![Riding Zone](CHI-E-Bike-Zone-Map.png)

### **Business Task**

Identify the distinctive behavior between casual riders and annual
members.

### **Expected Outcome**

At the end of this report, the analyzed information is expected to
assist the company to achieve their goal, and that is to convert
potential users, casual riders into annual members and consequently
increasing the profitability from the already existing pricing plans.

### **Involved Stakeholders**

-   **Cyclistic**: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800
    bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by
    also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes,
    making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and
    riders who can't use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of
    riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the
    assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for
    leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

-   **Lily Moreno**: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno
    is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to
    promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social
    media, and other channels.

-   **Cyclistic marketing analytics team**: A team of data analysts who
    are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that
    helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six
    months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic's mission and
    business goals --- as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can
    help Cyclistic achieve them.

-   **Cyclistic executive team**: The notoriously detail-oriented
    executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended
    marketing program.

## **Data Description**

### **Clarification**

The datasets used in this case study are obtained from the DIVVY bicycle
sharing service that is located in Chicago, United States. It was made
available by Motivate International Inc. under this
[license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). The
datasets has a different name since Cyclistic is a fictional company.
The datasets can be downloaded from [this
link](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

In this case study, the previous 12 months of trip data will be used
which is from September 2021 until August 2022. Based on the ROCCC
concept, which are reliable, original, comprehensive, current and cited,
the datasets are considered unbias and has a good credibility. There is
no standard station ID format but it does not bring any significant
impact to this case study.

-   **Reliable** - The source of the datasets are collected by DIVVY
    bicycle sharing service, the location data can be plotted on the map
    using Tableau / Power BI.

-   **Original** - The datasets are collected by DIVVY bicycle sharing
    service, an existing company and it is considered as a first-party
    data source.

-   **Comprehensive** - The datasets has the right data for the business
    task.

-   **Current** - The datasets are from recent dates (September 2021
    until August 2022).

-   **Cited** - The datasets are from DIVVY bicycle sharing service's
    official website with provided license.

## **Data Cleaning Process**

The tools that are used during the data cleaning process are RStudio to
produce a R markdown report and to remove any unnecessary data such as
duplicate data and null data while Excel and Tableau are used for the
purpose of data visualization.

### **Importing Data**

The following codes are used to import the 12 months of data from the
spreadsheets into RStudio for data cleaning purposes.

```{r , echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
sep_2021 <- read.csv("202109-divvy-tripdata.csv")
oct_2021 <- read.csv("202110-divvy-tripdata.csv")
nov_2021 <- read.csv("202111-divvy-tripdata.csv")
dec_2021 <- read.csv("202112-divvy-tripdata.csv")
jan_2022 <- read.csv("202201-divvy-tripdata.csv")
feb_2022 <- read.csv("202202-divvy-tripdata.csv")
mar_2022 <- read.csv("202203-divvy-tripdata.csv")
apr_2022 <- read.csv("202204-divvy-tripdata.csv")
may_2022 <- read.csv("202205-divvy-tripdata.csv")
jun_2022 <- read.csv("202206-divvy-tripdata.csv")
jul_2022 <- read.csv("202207-divvy-tripdata.csv")
aug_2022 <- read.csv("202208-divvy-tripdata.csv")

```

### **Merging datasets**

The datasets are merged into a single file named all_trips.

```{r , echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
all_trips <- bind_rows(sep_2021, oct_2021, nov_2021, dec_2021, jan_2022, feb_2022, mar_2022, apr_2022, may_2022, jun_2022, jul_2022, aug_2022)
```

The total entries from September 2021 to August 2022 are 5,883,043
entries.

### **Data Cleaning Steps**

Before proceeding towards analyzing the merged datasets, few cleaning
steps are done to prevent errors such as blank rows and negative values.

Using RStudio

1.Remove redundant columns

```{r , echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
all_trips <- all_trips %>%
  select(-c(start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng))

```

The number of columns reduces from 13 columns to 9 columns.

2.Rename similar groups with different names

```{r , echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
all_trips <-  all_trips %>%
  mutate(member_casual = recode(member_casual
                                ,"Subscriber" = "member"
                                ,"Customer" = "casual"))

```

Every entries that are named "Subscriber" are renamed as "member" and
"Customer" as "casual".

3.Date formatting

```{r , echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
all_trips$date <- as.Date(all_trips$started_at,"%d/%m/%Y") 
all_trips$day_of_week <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%A")
all_trips$month <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%m")
all_trips$day <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%d")
all_trips$year <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%Y")
```

The number of columns increases from 9 columns to 14 columns.

4.Convert ride_length into numeric format

```{r , echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
all_trips$ride_length <-  as.difftime(all_trips$ride_length, units = "secs")
all_trips$ride_length <- as.numeric(as.character(all_trips$ride_length))

```

Adding one more column to the dataset.

5.Remove unwanted data (entries where the bikes are taken to maintenance
or ride_length with negative values or rows with NA entries)

```{r , echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
all_trips_v2 <- all_trips[!(all_trips$start_station_name == "HQ QR" | all_trips$ride_length<0) ,]
all_trips_v2 = subset(all_trips_v2, !is.na(ride_length))

```

The number of entries reduce from 5,883,043 to 5,882,926 entries.

6.Remove empty entries at starting station and ending station columns

```{r , echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
trips_edited = subset(trips,!trips$start_station_name==""&trips$end_station_name=="")
trips_edited1 = subset(trips, !trips$start_station_name=="")
trips_edited2 = subset(trips, !trips$end_station_name=="")
```

This removes 1,322,862 entries which leaves a total of 4,560,064
entries.

Some of the stations such as Streeter Dr & Grand Ave Station, Millennium
Park Station, Theater on the Lake Station, DuSable Lake Shore Dr & North
Blvd Station and DuSable Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St Station are built
near tourist attraction such as Navy Pier or Millenium Park which will
attract tourists and locals to ride along the harbour or coastline. In
addition to that, there are multiple parks such as Olive Park, DuSable
Park around the stations that encourages users to ride around with a
bike.

Other stations such as Michigan Ave & Oak St Station, Wells St & Concord
Ln Staion, Clark St & Elm Station, Wells St & Elm St Station and
Kingsbury St & Kinzie St Station are popular as there are no metro
station near these station which encourages the people to move around
with a bicycle in addition to the well structured bike lane around the
area.

2.Bike Types and Member Types

| Riding Length (seconds) | Member | Casual |
|-------------------------|--------|--------|
| Max                     | 86,128 | 86,362 |

: Average Ride Length (seconds) By Rider Type

![Average Ride Length By Rider
Type](Average%20Ride%20Length%20By%20Rider%20Type.png)

From this summary, it would seem that the average casual riders (around
25 mins) tend to rent the bikes longer than average member riders
(around 13 mins). The median shows that most casual riders will rent
bikes for around 15 mins while member riders will rent bikes for around
10 mins. With this information, an average casual riders would yield \$5
of profit per ride while an average member rider would yield \$119 of
profit per annum. Besides that, the average ride length for the casual
members are almost constant which shows that there are daily users in
them.

![Number of Rides For Each Time Period](Picture1.png)

The amount of casual member is around 41.2% (1,877,953) of the overall
number of rides which shows that converting them to annual member is a
workable solution into increasing the profit of the company. Considering
30% of the total users choose this service to commute to work everyday,
it would be better to target this group of people that are currently not
an annual member. The majority of the rides at 7 AM and 8 AM are from
annual members which shows that they use this service to commute to work
or study frequently. The percentage of casual members slowly increases
after those period. The peak period of this bicycle service is at the
time period around 5 to 6 PM with the most casual members of the day..

| Bike Type     | Member    | Casual    | Total     |

: Number of Rides Based on Different Bike Types and Member Types

![Number of Rides for Each Bike Types and Member
Types](Number%20of%20Riders%20for%20Each%20Bike%20Types%20and%20Member%20Types.png)

Based on the above figure, docked bikes are not as popular as electric
bike and classic bike. This is mainly caused by the limited docking
stations available around Chicago. Docked bikes may not even be
available during haevy traffic hours. In addition to that, it is not
friendly to new cyclists as they are required to search a docking
station in unfamiliar places which is better for them to pick a classic
bike or an electric bike to move around.

Electric bikes are better than docked bikes since it is easier to ride
but it has similar problem to the docking stations which is the charging
stations. The users will have to change batteries after it was depleted
which requires them to search for its stations. Some users may
experience renting a not fully charged electric bike.

As an article posted on Streetsblog Chicago by Courtney Cobbson on May 5
2022, 5 charging stations was set at the following locations, Wilton
Avenue and Diversey Parkway, Lincoln Avenue and Roscoe Street, Bissell
Street and Armitage Avenue, Green Street and Randolph Street, Morgan
Street and Lake Street in order to charge the new e-bikes. This was done
to prevent multiple trips to exchange the electric bikes' battery and to
prevent any electric bikes that is not fully charged being rented by
people.  

![](FSA3VBRXoAE2L6X.png)

Casual bikes are the most popular bikes among the three as the docking
locations are very flexible, the users can dock their bikes any stations
in Chicago and anywhere in the scooter zone for an extra charge of \$1
for Divvy members and \$2 for non-members.

: Number of Rides By Member Types and Weekdays

![Number of Rides By Member Type and
Weekdays](Number%20of%20Rides%20By%20Rider%20Type.png)

The number of riders shown for every different days are at a stable
value, there is no drastic increase or decrease in values for each day.
This shows that everyday bike riding is becoming a normal thing to the
residents of Chicago. This also shows that these casual riders are
similar to the annual riders that they ride bikes everyday for works and
as a mean to move around in the city. The slight increase and decrease
in riders can represent tourists that visits Chicago while the majority
of the riders are locals.

![Number of Rides From September 2021 to August
2022](Number%20of%20Rides%20From%20September%202021%20to%20August%202022.png)

The number of rides for each month is shown in the figure above. The
number of rides are at the lowest in January 2022, followed by February
2022 and December 2021. This is due to different seasons that worsen the
road condition and the drastic change in temperature which is not
suitable for cycling. The following figure shows the temperature change
in Fahrenheit for year 2021 and 2022.

As shown in the figure above, the average temperature at the month of
January 2022 is in between 22 Fahrenheit to 33 Fahrenheit. This freezing
temperature is not suitable for outdoor activity. So, the only users
that are using this service at this month would be annual members for
the purpose of travelling to work or study. This results in the low
number of casual members because of the low temperature. In between June
and September, the average temperature is suitable for outdoor activity
which attracts tourists to come which is shown by the increase of casual
members in number starting from May 2022.

## **Solution**

1.Increase the cost per minute for the single-ride pass by \$0.02

The reason for this approach is to make the users think that applying
the annual membership is a better decision. Even if they think
otherwise, the increased price of the single-ride pass is still
profitable to the company. By taking the average duration for a casual
rider in the analysis section, the profit will increase from \$5 to
\$5.5.

2.Improve the advertisement for E-bike service

The price for the E-bike service for annual member is the same as
renting a casual bike as a casual member which is \$1 + \$0.16 / minute.
They would consider to be a good deal when the comparison is made clear
to them.

3.Consider helmet renting service

A helmet is a must to ride a bike for safety reason but it is not
convenient to carry around a helmet when not riding a bike. With this
service, people would feel more accessible to use this bike renting
service especially when there is an emergency. It would be a plus if
there is a small discount when the helmet is returned to the stations to
prevent any loss helmet. An easier way to prevent helmet went lost is to
pair each bike with their own helmets to track records.
